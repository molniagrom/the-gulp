## Installation

The easiest way to install acorn is with [`npm`][npm].

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

```sh
npm install acorn
```

Alternately, download the source.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ternjs/acorn.git
```

## Components

When run in a CommonJS (node.js) or AMD environment, exported values
appear in the interfaces exposed by the individual files, as usual.
When loaded in the browser (Acorn works in any JS-enabled browser more
recent than IE5) without any kind of module management, a single
global object `acorn` will be defined, and all the exported properties
will be added to that.

### Main parser

This is implemented in `dist/acorn.js`, and is what you get when you
`require("acorn")` in node.js.

**parse**`(input, options)` is used to parse a JavaScript program.
The `input` parameter is a string, `options` can be undefined or an
object setting some of the options listed below. The return value will
be an abstract syntax tree object as specified by the
[ESTree spec][estree].

When  encountering   a  syntax   error,  the   parser  will   raise  a
`SyntaxError` object with a meaningful  message. The error object will
have a `pos` property that indicates the character offset at which the
error occurred,  and a `loc`  object that contains a  `{line, column}`
object referring to that same position.

- **ecmaVersion**: Indicates the ECMAScript version to parse. Must be
  either 3, 5, 6, or 7. This influences support for strict mode, the set
  of reserved words, and support for new syntax features. Default is 6.

  **NOTE**: Only 'stage 4' (finalized) ECMAScript 7 features are being
  implemented by Acorn. That means that most of the draft standard is
  not yet being parsed.

- **sourceType**: Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be
  either `"script"` or `"module"`.

- **onInsertedSemicolon**: If given a callback, that callback will be
  called whenever a missing semicolon is inserted by the parser. The
  callback will be given the character offset of the point where the
  semicolon is inserted as argument, and if `locations` is on, also a
  `{line, column}` object representing this position.

- **onTrailingComma**: Like `onInsertedSemicolon`, but for trailing
  commas.

- **allowReserved**: If `false`, using a reserved word will generate
  an error. Defaults to `true` for `ecmaVersion` 3, `false` for higher
  versions. When given the value `"never"`, reserved words and
  keywords can also not be used as property names (as in Internet
  Explorer's old parser).

- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: By default, a return statement at
  the top level raises an error. Set this to `true` to accept such
  code.

- **allowImportExportEverywhere**: By default, `import` and `export`
  declarations can only appear at a program's top level. Setting this
  option to `true` allows them anywhere where a statement is allowed.

- **allowHashBang**: When this is enabled (off by default), if the
  code starts with the characters `#!` (as in a shellscript), the
  first line will be treated as a comment.

- **locations**: When `true`, each node has a `loc` object attached
  with `start` and `end` subobjects, each of which contains the
  one-based line and zero-based column numbers in `{line, column}`
  form. Default is `false`.

- **onToken**: If a function is passed
